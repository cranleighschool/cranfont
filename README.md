# CRANFONT
Cranfont is a web font designed to allow us to use Cranleigh Logos as icons on our websites.

##Usage
Download the entire repository ensuring you keep the file paths and folders the same. 

In your HTML include the stylesheet: 
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="<path_to_cranfont>/cranfont.css" />
```

Referenceing an icon is quite similar to how <a href="http://fontawesome.io">FontAwesome</a> works. First give the element a class of ```cranfont``` followed by the name of the icon you wish it to be prefixed with ```cranfont-```, eg:
```html
<i class="cranfont cranfont-logo"></i>
```
